# Information for 1621_Be9
Nucleus     :   Be9
Onebody     :   SPE
Twobody     :   strictly ijkl where i<j, k>l, j>=k
Description :   With Helium Core
                Twobody = (5,4) in (8,8)
                two_factor is 0.5; (antisymmetrized TBME)
                Seniority force -Gq/(11+Nq); Nq neutron = 5, Nq proton = 4, Gq = (follows the naming of the dir)
                source file = Be9_610(only onebody uses that): results from SIII HF-para         

                WITH ADDITIONAL TERMS, not a real calculation, this is to check the if the ansatz selection responds to the terms in hamiltonian
