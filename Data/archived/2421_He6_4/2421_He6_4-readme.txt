Nucleus     :   He6
Onebody     :   SPE
Twobody     :   strictly ijkl where i<j, k>l, j>=k
Description :   With Helium Core
                Twobody = (4,2) in (6,4) (preserve_spin  == True)
                two_factor is 0.5; (antisymmetrized TBME)
                Seniority force -Gq/(11+Nq); Nq neutron = 4, Nq proton = 2, Gq = 4
                source file = He6_2400(only onebody uses that): results from SLy4 HF-para (SPE corrected)
