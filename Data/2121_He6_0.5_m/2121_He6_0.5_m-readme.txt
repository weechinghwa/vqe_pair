# Information for 2121_He6
Nucleus     :   He6
Onebody     :   SPE
Twobody     :   strictly ijkl where i<j, k>l, j>=k
Description :   With Helium Core
                Twobody = (4,2) in (6,8)
                two_factor is 0.5; (antisymmetrized TBME)
                Seniority force -Gq/(11+Nq); Nq neutron = 4, Nq proton = 2, Gq = 0.5
                source file = He6_2100(only onebody uses that): results from SLy4 HF-para
