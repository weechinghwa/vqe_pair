# Information for 207 (bigtitle)


203_Be8 is generated using /Data/Be8_SIII_new

it is the calculation that is from the SIII calculation.
iHF and jHF are time conjugates respectively (to find out what they means), for example 1 to 3 means 1,2 to 3,4 promotion
3 6 promotion would mean 3,4 to 5,6 (only positive spin will be listed)

Onebody terms are quasiparticle energiven by E_iqp = sqrt( (e_i - e_f)^2 + (\delta)^2 ), where delta is the pairing gap, it is zero in this case. 

this file contain flawed data with repeated pairing terms. (does not matter when imported as FermionicOp, only 12 terms will be left out.) 


## Information for 204
########################################################## THE above are of the same as the 203 data

The data here has Hermitian twobody terms.

########################################################## The following are what updated from 204 and 203
Onebody terms: Single particle energy levels
Twobody terms: Hermitian
