Onebody     :   SPE
Twobody     :   strictly ijkl where i<j, k>l, j>=k
Description :   With Oxygen Core (8 is magic number)
                Twobody = (2,0) in (8,0)
                two_factor is 0.5; (antisymmetrized TBME)
                Seniority force -Gq/(11+Nq); Nq neutron = 10, Nq proton = 8, Gq = 5
                source file = O18_2100(only onebody uses that): results from SLy4 HF-para
